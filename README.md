## Description

***Diablo III*** is a popular action role-playing game which was developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment, and over 20 million copies have been sold until today.

The game was first released in May 2012, then its expansion set, _Reaper of Souls_, was available in March 2014. Alhtough no further expansions have been developed afterwards (except _Rise of the Necromancer_ DLC), this RPG game was kept up-to-date by receiving new contents, seasons, landmarks, monsters and quality of life improvements patch by patch.

Within more than 8 years of its existence, Diablo III is still being played by several players worldwide, mainly due to _three-months-long seasons_ that include conquests, ladders, season-wide unique buffs for fresh competitions.

The datasets I've compiled and provided here, containing various data, depend on the _PC version_ of this game with the latest released patch (2.6.9).

**Stay tuned for analyses of these data inside!**

## Available Datasets

* **Game difficulties** - Info about effects of baseline difficulty up to the highest one
* **Gem attributes** - Gem effects when socketed into items
* **Chacracter level XP** - Character level experience requirements between 1-70
* **Paragon level XP** - Paragon level experience requirements (_up to 800; some missing values exist_)
* **Quest level ranges** - Level requirements for quests in the story campaign before 2.0.1 was released
* **Unique monsters** - Name and titles of unique monsters in all acts (_the list might be incomplete_)

## Source

Many of these data were obtained from [Diablo III's Official Web Site](https://eu.diablo3.com/en/game/), and the rest (such as XP, monsters) were collected by myself.

## Spoiler ALERT!

If you never played this game before, or have played it for a while but did not return afterwards, keep in mind that these datasets contain **heavy amount of spoilers** about the game! ***Inspect them at your own risk!***

## Future Plans

In the future, I'd like to create more individual datasets with these categories below, for more utilization of my analyses:

* Weapons
* Armors
* Artisans
* Legendary gems
* Character Skills
